## How to Run

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Configure `.env.local` with database and Clerk keys
3. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
4. Generate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
5. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
6. Open http://localhost:3000

## Key Features Implemented

âœ… User authentication with Clerk  
âœ… Profile management  
âœ… Skill listing creation  
âœ… Marketplace browsing  
âœ… Intelligent matching algorithm  
âœ… GraphQL API with full CRUD operations  
âœ… Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS  
âœ… Protected routes with middleware  
âœ… Database schema with relationships  

## Next Steps for Full MVP

1. Implement WebSocket chat system
2. Complete rating/reputation flow
3. Add real-time notifications
